 // Four Types of Observable using From

 // convert various other objects and data types into Observables
    // 1. fromIterable
    // 2. fromArray
    // 3. fromCallable
    // 4.fromPublisher


# Types of  operators
   1. Transforming Operator
      1.1 Buffer   =>  periodically gather items from an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time
      1.1 Flatmap  =>  Transmit the item, After applying function to modify it BUT it returns observale, Doesn't maintain order
      1.1 GroupBy  =>  Make group based on criteria
      1.1 map      =>  Transmit the item, After applying function to modify it
      1.1 Scan     =>
      1.1 window   =>

   2. Filtering Operator
      2.1 Debounce  => Only emit an Item from Obswrvale Only After certain amount has been passed
      2.2 Distinct  =>  Remove duplicates, Only Unique
      2.3 ElementAt  => Element At Index
      2.4 Filter    =>  Filter emitted stream based on some condition
      2.5 First
      2.6 Ignore Element  => Ignore element
      2.7 Last
      2.8 Sample
      2.9 Skip      => Ignore n elements from stream, Skip(6) -> skip first SIX elements
      2.10 SkipLast
      2.11 Take     => Take only n elements from stream
      2.12 TakeLast


   3. Combining Operator

   4. Utility Operator

   5. Conditional Operator

   6. Connectable Operator
